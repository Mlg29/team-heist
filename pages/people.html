                    Hopper every day. At the heart of Hopper is our users’ trust in us, our<br> expertise, and our passion. So everything we build, we build for them.</p>
                    <p  class="peopleSection__text">We move quickly, testing and iterating, thinking big and planning for the<br> future we want, where everyone can travel. Peek any whiteboard and<br>
                         you’ll find grand plans. Pop into a meeting and hear world-changing,<br>
                          maybe even crazy, ideas. Scribble solutions on a napkin. Brainstorm<br> over the espresso machine. This is how we build — together.</p>

                         affordable, we’re breaking down the barrier to adventure at scale. The speed at which we
                          design, form, and deploy changes create a
                           dream environment for those who thrive on independence.</p>
                        <p  class="mobilePeopleSection__text">Our approach is one centred around consistent
                             communication, earning users trust. We avoid 
                             outdated pressure tactics and opt instead for
                              what we believe is the future of great travel. A
                               tailored solution, that removes anxiety around
                                decision making, ensuring the user always
                                 finds the best possible deal, within a process
                                  that's playful and effortless.
